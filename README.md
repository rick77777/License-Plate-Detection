G17_Project_Report - Project report for the License Plate detection project
Project_run_3 - Consists of the code that actually does the license plate detection

To run the code with your own images you need to change the specific image path
specified as "image_path = f'/content/drive/MyDrive/content/{i}.jpg'"

A zip file containing 11 sample images is also present which will give the same
result each time
